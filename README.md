# Integral-Calculation
Here is a project of computation of integrals in python.
I will add files but the first file can compute Integrals with constant sign on an interval [a,b] whit the Monte-Carlo method.
I hope I will find a way to fix how to calculate integrals with change of sign. If you have any question or suggestion just send me an email at:

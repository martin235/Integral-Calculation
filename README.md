# Integral-Calculation
Here is a project of computation of integrals in python.
I will add files but the first file can compute Integrals with constant sign on an interval [a,b] whit the Monte-Carlo method.
I just finished to work on the project and I found a way to calculate integrals who have change of sign. This program can actually calculate any integrals except integrals who have asymptots on the interval [a;b]. The program gives an approximation to 1% of error of the actual value. I hope I could fix this to have 0.01% of approximation. If you have any question or suggestion just send me an email at: martin.bacques.mb@gmail.com
